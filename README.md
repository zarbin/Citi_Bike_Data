The Seasonality and Usage by Hour Dashboard highlights time based used as sepected between three visuals. 

Seasonlity highlights the busier seasons of ridership and trends emerge with more significant riding ocucring in the summer monnths compared to winter. Also, a ridecount breakdown by day and hour is provided in a heatmap that clearly shows rush hours in the morning (6-8am)  and evening (5-7pm) accounting for the businest periods of riding.  On the weekends there is less temporal intensity and ridership count by hour is diffuse.  

Finally, a heatmap by day of week is shown reflecting that Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday are the busiest days of the week.
